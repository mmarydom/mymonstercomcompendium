           <br>
        <p>Always appearing at the corners of one’s eyes. These creatures may cause paranoia to most individuals. Sightings have been reported and documented as only its hands and face. </p>

    <h3>The Lost</h3>
    <br>
    <p>“I woke up to a loud crash and when I turned on the lights, that’s when I saw them… or at least I tried to see them.” </p>
   <br>
  <p>Although frightening to most individuals, the lost are harmless shadow spirits. They are found sometimes in groups or by themselves. Lost souls inhabit houses searching for a place to reside in. </p>

   <p>“Oh my God! The eyes! THE EYES! They’re inside my house and I’m home alone!” </p>
  <br>
 <p>This disembodied figure, so far, has never been seen in person – all except for their eyes. Most often, their eyes are the only things reflecting in the dark. Some reports have indicated these creatures devour the Lost but in exchange, it will reside in the homes they feast in. </p>

  <h3>Weeping Siren</h3>
  <br>
  <p>“I heard someone humming a sad tune from the bed rocks. I tried to follow it, but the more I got closer, the more it smelt like rotting meat.”</p>
 <br>
<p>Individuals report hearing a sad, lonely melody or tune whilst wandering the beaches. Locals who live near the beach have stated that this creature has missing limbs and decaying flesh, and to “ignore her cries as much as possible.” Those who follow her end up missing and return a dead body, rotting on the shores. </p>
