      <h2><p>About</p></h2>
       <br>
       <p>For project 1, I decided to emulate a bestiary or a compendium of imaginary monsters and evil spirits. Like a real-life bestiary, I provided a small collection of information used to identify certain monsters and to keep people aware of their presence. Despite the realistic imagery, my website is not meant to be taken seriously and the sole purpose is to entertain my viewers. I wanted to play around with the concept of monsters and thought it would be interesting to create a website dedicated to these creatures. I originally wanted to make everything with an Animal Crossing style/aesthetic, but due to time restraints, I went with a simpler design. The color pallet used for my website is inspired by Halloween, since I thought the colors were the most appropriate for the theme. All the art were made by me and the real images were edited through photoshop. I incorporated a little bit of JavaScript for the modals, but the rest of the website (animation included) were made through CSS and HTML.</p>
