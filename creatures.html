              <br>
              <p>“She looked like some kid in a cat costume. When I tried approaching her, I suddenly felt…somewhat uneasy. And then she was gone.”</p>
             <br>
          <p>Her real name remains unknown, but many refer to her as Mrs. Mittens because of her feline appearance. Many believed she’s the child of a lycanthrope of some kind,
            but no one can say for sure. Although she may seem like no real threat, it has been reported that those who come in contact with her are cursed with extreme misfortune.
            Some cases even involved death.</p>

     <br>
    <p>This is not the Spider-Man we know and love, but rather something from your nightmares. Eyewitnesses have reported this seen roaming the woods. Food sources include deer meat. </p>

   <p>This creature is believed to be a witch searching for her missing head. Said to have been decapitated and dons a bloodied bag. Can be found roaming the streets at midnight. </p>
