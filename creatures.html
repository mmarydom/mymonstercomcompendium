                        <p>Her real name remains unknown, but many refer to her as Mrs. Mittens because of her feline appearance. Many believed she’s the child of a lycanthrope of some kind, but no one can say for sure. Although she may seem like no real threat, it has been reported that those who come in contact with her are cursed with extreme misfortune. Some cases even involved death.</p>
